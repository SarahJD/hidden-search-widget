**Hidden Search Widget**

Click on the button with the search icon, and it shows a search input bar.

The button fires off a JavaScript event that adds a specific class that expands the width of the input and moves the button to the right.

I used CSS transitions along with a bit of JavaScript to add the event and toggle the class.

This is the 4th project from Brad Traversy's Udemy Course "50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript".
